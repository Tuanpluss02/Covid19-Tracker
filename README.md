# Covid19 Tracker

The COVID-19 Tracker is an efficient mobile application designed to provide real-time data and statistics on the COVID-19 pandemic. Built using the Flutter framework, this project leverages the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern and isolates to ensure optimal performance and maintainability.

The project aims to deliver a user-friendly interface that allows users to stay informed about the latest COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, and other relevant information. By utilizing BLoC architecture, the application separates the business logic from the user interface, providing a scalable and modular structure for managing data flow and state management.

# The application offers a range of features, including:

- Global and regional COVID-19 statistics: Users can view up-to-date statistics on confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases worldwide or filter the data by specific regions or countries.
- Data visualization: The project incorporates interactive charts and graphs to present COVID-19 trends over time, allowing users to analyze and understand the progression of the pandemic.
- News and updates: The application provides news articles and updates related to COVID-19, ensuring users are well-informed about the latest developments.
- Push notifications: Users can opt to receive push notifications for critical updates, such as significant spikes in cases or changes in government guidelines, keeping them informed and alert.
- Search and filtering: The application enables users to search for specific countries, regions, or even individual cities to obtain localized COVID-19 data.
